You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

 class Solution {
public:
    void rotate(vector<vector<int>>& arr) {
        int n = arr.size();
         for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
            swap(arr[i][j], arr[j][i]);
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        for (int j = 0; j < n / 2; j++)
            swap(arr[i][j], arr[i][n - 1 - j]);

   
    }
};
